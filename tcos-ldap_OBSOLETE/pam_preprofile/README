PAM_PREPROFILE
==============

This module ensures that some program or script is run each time a user
logs into the computer. Now, it isn't necessary to rely on a particular
shell to exec the user's .profile, .bash_profile, .bashrc or similar.

Such functionality can be used to create links from the user's home
directory to some location, or other needs.

The module was made as a modification of the example module
"pam_permit".

INSTALL & USAGE:

To install this module you must compile and copy it into a known
location, such as /lib/security
Next, edit /etc/pam.d/X, being X the PAM service you want the module to
run at (eg: su, gdm...). Add the following line at the end of the file:

session required pam_preprofile.so my_program param1 ... paramN

When my_program is called, it will receive param1 ... paramN, plus a
paramN+1 being the username that has just been authenticated. For
example:

----
session required pam_preprofile.so /tmp/myprogram.sh /usr/doc
----
#!/bin/sh
# This is /tmp/myprogram.sh
echo "Hello $2. Please, read the docs at $1."
----

NOTE:

This module was written and tested only on Debian 3.0 (Woody)
