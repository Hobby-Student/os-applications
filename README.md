Application packages for openthinclient OS, version 2.x
==============

This repo provides the recipers for building all application packages - one application per folder. 
Please install the tcos-dev package on a debian wheezy or use our docker container and read [this](http://openthinclient.org/Packaging%20Tutorial?structure=#2_create_OTC_Packages) 
to know how to use the tcos-dev tools.

While the documentation is slightly outdated, the use of the tools is still the same.

**Please note: This repository is about application for openthinclient OS version 2.x (and above) only!
Any bug report or question about older versions will be silently rejected.**
